               Intel Broadwell BSP

1. About this document
======================

This BSP is optimized for the platforms based on Intel Broadwell CPU.
This BSP uses kernel and package architecture in the intel-x86 layer.

This document describes the dedicated contents for optimized features
and specific information.

Please refer to README.hardware of intel-x86 for specific hardware information.
Please refer to README of intel-x86 for common intel-x86 information.


Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the oe-core version supplied with Wind River
Linux, the wr-kernel and intel-x86 bsp layer.

Maintenance
-----------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.

Building the intel-broadwell layer
----------------------------------
This layer and the wr-kernel layer should be added to bblayers.conf. This
is done automatically when using the Wind River configure wrapper.

Note:
To build a 64-bit kernel + 64-bit rootfs, use:

    --enable-board=intel-broadwell-64

To build a 32-bit kernel + 32-bit rootfs combination, use
the following configuration:

    --enable-board=intel-broadwell-32

2. BSP Specific Patches
=======================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP along with
patch descriptions use git-whatchanged on the default kernel
(git-whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

        %> cd build/linux-windriver-<version>/linux
        %> git whatchanged standard/base..standard/intel-x86-64

Note:
intel-broadwell use the same branch as intel-x86 common bsp.
