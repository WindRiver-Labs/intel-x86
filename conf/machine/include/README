README for Intel-x86 bsp tuning files:

If the tuning file you're looking for isn't here, that may not be a bug!

1. Many tunings work with the standard oe-core tuning files, so we don't
need a special configuration file for them.

2. At least some tunings that we've supported in previous products have
either been replaced by an oe-core tune or are not currently supported.
Requesting an additional tuning is an enhancement request, not a bug report.
