This feature enables a full-feature development environment in intel-x86
BSP. It makes the development process easy when developers/testers want
to build their own applications on the target instead of on build host.

For other BSP related features that this template includes, please refer
to file "require".

To use this feature, add --templates feature/intel-x86-dev.
